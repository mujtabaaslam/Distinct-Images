By utilizing GIMP, Mediascript and Scheme, we created a program that produces over 1000 unique images.
Although these images aren't representational, they are abstract images which explore a sense of depth and perception
in various colors and shapes.

More details are explained in our design and technique statements below:

Design Statement:
Through our project we explore various colors, shapes and their depths. Our project consists of a series of rectangular trails
of various color combination aligned beside each other. To give an interesting edge to our images we created an abstract 
object in the background; as n increases the object gets smaller for every 250 values of n. After 250 values it reverts back
to its original size. In addition we also varied the length, color and the number of trails; changed the size of the abstract 
object as well as its color; and also changed the orientation of the images. 

In order to manipulate the colors, we used different combination of colors of the trails, the abstract object, the turtle 
drawing, and the background. We used different combination of blends and saturation to make our project more interesting 
and aesthetically appealing. To explore different shapes we created various shapes at the end of the trail. One of the shapes
takes the form very similar to a star while others represent simplified complex polygons. As an addition, we also manipulated
the trails height which graphs the cos function, representing the beauty of calculus. We manipulated with the sizes and the 
number of our objects in our images. Different images contains different sizes of the abstract object as well as different 
number of trails. 

Technical Statement:

To create our project we used various image-creating techniques. We used turtles to create the shapes at the end of the trails.
Another technique we used was image-compute. Using image-compute we gave a nice blend of color to the background as well as
out trails. The third image making technique we used was drawings. We used it to create our abstract drawing which basically
consists of circles inside circles of various colors. We also used Gimp techniques to create multiple copies of our trails on
the same image. 

In order to create 1000 different images we varied a number of things in our project. After every 250 values of n,the image 
rotates, resulting in a different orientation. The size of the abstract object decreases with respect to cosine function for 
every 250 values of n. The number of trails in any given image changes for every 8 values of n. There are 7 color combination 
of our abstract object whereas there are 4 combination of our turtle drawings. Every multiple of 56 as the value of n produces 
similar images. However, we can clearly see that the size of the abstract object as well as the background has changed. Every 
image changes the background color combination slightly but the change is noticed only after 50 or so vales of n. In fact, for
250 values of n the background completely changes, meaning we used a completely different combination of the irgb colors. One 
cannot even begin to imagine the possibilities once all the above combinations are put together.
